I started this project because there were a few technologies and services that I wanted to try out. I hadn't had the chance to work with these technologies at my day job, so I figured the best way to learn these technologies would be to build something with them. Doga Todo is the result. Check out the deployed version of the app <a href="https://doga-todo.vercel.app">here</a>.

Of course the app had to look good and be performant as well. Now I know a lot of design decisions are subjective, but at least we have a way to quantify performance. My goal was to get a perfect score using Google Lighthouse, and luckily I was able to do so.
